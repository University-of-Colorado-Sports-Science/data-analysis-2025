# 2025 CU Athletic Department Internship Program
Welcome to the home base for the 2025 CU Athletic Department Sports Science internship program! This GitHub repository will be the center of all the work you will create for your internship projects these next 8 weeks! In order to stay organized, please use appropriate file nesting with legible titles, meaningful file names, clear commit messages, commented code, good variable names, and strong note-taking methodology. Everyone has a unique workflow when it comes to data analysis, so it is at your discretion to choose what works for you when deciding on your organization methods.

## Getting Started

###  Installing Git and RStudio
1. Download and install [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git)
2. Download and install [RStudio (1.1.383 or higher)](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

### Clone the `data-analysis-2025` repository in order to collaborate with your teammates and the CU Sports Science staff
1. On GitHub, navigate to the Code tab of the repository.
2. On the right side of the screen, click `Clone or download`.
3. Click the `Copy to clipboard` icon to the right of the repository URL.
4. Open RStudio on your local environment.
5. Click File, `New Project`, `Version Control`, `Git`.
6. Paste the repository URL and enter TAB to move to the `Project directory` name field.
7. Click `Create Project`.

### Next Steps
Now that you have the repository downloaded, open the R Markdown file entitled `data-analysis-2025.Rmd`. This will be the notebook where you are expected to compile your full data workflow with meaningful comments, accurate variable names, create visualizations, and perform your data analysis. Feel free to create additional R notebooks or R script files to explore the workflows you want to implement without doing work in the main document. The main `data-analysis-2025.Rmd` file has a few included libraries and headings to get you started and show some expected formatting. 

The `data-sets` folder in the repository is the home for all of the cleansed data sets that will be provided to you from the CU Sports Science Team. They will be in both Excel (`.xlsx`) and Comma Separated Value (`.csv`) format for flexibility.

The `notes` folder in the repository will be home to all note-taking documents throughout the project. Feel free to upload PDF (`.pdf`), Word (`.docx`), Plain text (`.txt`), Markdown (`.md`), or any other note document to this folder. Note taking is expected in meetings, researching, and general brainstorming. While not explicitly required, it will be helpful to see your thought processes if you encounter roadblocks, so good and thoughtful note-taking will only benefit you in the long-run.

Feel free to create any other folders within the repository as you see fit. All we ask is that you keep the files we provide to you in their original file folder destinations.
